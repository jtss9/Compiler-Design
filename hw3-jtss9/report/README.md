## How much time did you spend on this project

about 3 days then give up :(

## Project overview
### class.hpp / class.cpp
I follow the spec and define the class for each node (e.g. function.hpp, function.cpp ...). Add the definition and define two more function "accept" and "visitChildNodes".

### scanner.l
Assign the value from the token to ```yylval```, so that parser can get the value of the variable.(e.g. yylval.bool_value = true;)

### parser.y
I have no idea what i've done.\
But after I screwed up the whole parser, i think i have a better understanding of this matter.\
However, it's a little bit late if i redo this homework.

## What is the hardest you think in this project

EVERYTHINGGGGGGGGG!

## Feedback to T.A.s

Sorry for wasting TA's time on grading my homework :(
